# Hybridized-DDF-Model
This repository contains scripts for modeling hybrid Depth-Duration-Frequency (DDF) estimates across multiple durations and return periods. The advanced method combines the Gumbel, Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, Exponential, and Generalized Pareto PDFs to create a hybridized PDF model for estimating DDFs.
